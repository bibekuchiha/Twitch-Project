# Twitch-Project

[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) is the world’s leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation. Its live and on-demand video platform forms the backbone of a distribution network for video game broadcasters including professional players, tournaments, leagues, developers and gaming media organizations.

In this project, we have partnered with Twitch’s Science Team and you will be working with two related tables that describe user engagement with Twitch video and chat. The project is broken down into two parts:
<br>
[Part 1: Analyze Data with SQL](https://github.com/bibekuchiha/Twitch-Project/blob/master/test.sql)<br>
[Part 2: Visualize Data with Matplotlib](https://github.com/bibekuchiha/Twitch-Project/blob/master/Twitch.ipynb)

<br>

Note: The data is scrubbed and is meant for practice use only.
